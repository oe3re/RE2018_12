Find the resistor 


Write a code that will help our students find the right resistors faster. Student inputs the whole number that represents wanted value for the resistance, and the program should display in console 4 rectangles whose colors should represent that value (one that represents tolerance is omitted). The program by going through the look up table of colors which is given, should display colors that are matching the input resistance value. If the user inputs the value that doesnâ€™t exist in the look up table, the message should notify the user about that and the program should display the colors of the resistance that is the closest to the input one.
